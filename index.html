    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <div class="con">
        <ol>
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
            <li>CSS describes how HTML ekements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
            <li><span class="lt">CSS is not necessary</span><span class="bg">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can
                control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
            <li><span class="bt">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h2>
    <div class="con2">
        <ul>
            <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</li>
            <li>Internal - by using style element is head section.</li>
            <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span
                    class="bg">in this tutorial
                    we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for
                you to try
                it yourself.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="con3">
        <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements, ID, on
            the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL
            to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element
            has been targetred, a style or setof styles can be applied to the element.</p>
        <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to
            target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
